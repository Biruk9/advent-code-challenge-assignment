Report: Ceres Search – Counting Occurrences of “XMAS”
Problem Overview

You were given a word search grid containing letters arranged in rows and columns. The task was to find all occurrences of the word XMAS in the grid. The word could appear:

Horizontally (left → right or right → left)

Vertically (top → bottom or bottom → top)

Diagonally in any direction

Overlapping other words

The goal was to count every valid occurrence of XMAS regardless of orientation or overlap.

Approach
Step 1: Read the Word Search Grid

Open the input file input1.txt.

Read each line into a 2D array grid[MAX][MAX].

Track the number of rows and columns.

Remove newline characters at the end of each line.

while(fgets(grid[rows], MAX, f)) {
    int len = strlen(grid[rows]);
    if(grid[rows][len-1] == '\n') grid[rows][len-1] = '\0';
    if(cols == 0) cols = strlen(grid[rows]);
    rows++;
}

Step 2: Define Directions to Search

Define 8 directions for searching the word

This allows the word to be found in all possible orientations.

Step 3: Scan the Grid

Loop over every cell (i,j) in the grid.

For each cell, attempt to match the word XMAS in all 8 directions.

Use a nested loop for the length of the word (k = 0 to 3).

Compute the next cell (ni, nj) = (i + dx[dir]*k, j + dy[dir]*k).

If (ni,nj) goes outside the grid or the character does not match, break.

If all letters match, increment the counter.

for(int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        for(int dir = 0; dir < 8; dir++) {
            int k;
            for(k = 0; k < word_len; k++) {
                int ni = i + dx[dir]*k;
                int nj = j + dy[dir]*k;
                if(ni < 0 || nj < 0 || ni >= rows || nj >= cols) break;
                if(grid[ni][nj] != WORD[k]) break;
            }
            if(k == word_len) count++;
        }
    }
}

Step 4: Output the Result

After scanning the entire grid, print the total count of XMAS occurrences.

printf("Total occurrences of '%s': %d\n", WORD, count);

8-directional search ensures no occurrence is missed.

Bounds checking prevents access outside the grid.

Overlapping occurrences are counted individually.

Efficient use of nested loops allows scanning large grids quickly.

After processing the input word search:

Total occurrences of "XMAS" = 2633
